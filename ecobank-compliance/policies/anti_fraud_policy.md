# Anti-Fraud Policy

## 1. Introduction 

### 1.1 Objective
This policy defines the framework for preventing and combating fraud within lomi.africa Inc. It aims to protect our platform, customers, and partners against any fraudulent activity.

### 1.2 Scope of Application 
The anti-fraud policy applies to all activities of lomi.africa Inc., including:
- Financial transactions processed on our platform 
- The process of creating and managing user accounts
- The use of services by customers and partners
- The protection of personal and confidential data

## 2. Types of Fraud Monitored

### 2.1 Transactional Fraud
Transactional fraud covers all types of unauthorized or illegitimate transactions, such as the use of stolen or counterfeit payment cards, transactions carried out by identity theft, fraudulent requests for refunds or cancellations, and payments made with funds of illicit origin.

### 2.2 Identity Fraud
Identity fraud consists of creating false identities or impersonating third parties for illegitimate purposes. This can take the form of using falsified or stolen identity documents, creating online accounts with false information, hijacking existing accounts by stealing credentials, and complicity in fraud by customers or partners.

### 2.3 Merchant Fraud 
Merchant fraud involves dishonest merchants or service providers who abuse our platform. Scenarios include creating fake merchant accounts for illegitimate activities, carrying out fictitious transactions to inflate volumes, overcharging or billing for services not rendered, and using our platform for money laundering.

## 3. Prevention Measures

### 3.1 Identity Verification
We apply strict identity verification procedures for all users of our platform. These procedures include systematically validating provided identity documents, using biometric verification solutions where appropriate, checking the consistency of identity and contact information, and verifying physical and electronic addresses. These controls are reinforced for high-risk accounts and suspicious transactions.

### 3.2 Transaction Monitoring
All transactions on our platform are monitored in real-time to detect anomalies and suspicious patterns. Our monitoring system includes analysis rules based on predefined risk criteria, scoring algorithms to assess the risk level of transactions, transaction limits adapted to user profiles, and automated alerts in case of threshold overruns or unusual behavior. Suspicious transactions are preventively blocked and subjected to in-depth analysis.

### 3.3 Technical Security 
We implement advanced technical security measures to prevent intrusions and identity theft, including end-to-end encryption of sensitive data, anti-phishing solutions to prevent credential theft, strong multi-factor authentication for sensitive access, and continuous monitoring of infrastructure and access. Our infrastructure is regularly audited and updated to adapt to new threats.

## 4. Fraud Detection

### 4.1 Detection Tools
Our fraud detection system relies on a combination of complementary tools, including a configurable rule engine to identify suspicious patterns, machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies, behavioral analysis of users and transactions, and a real-time alert system with criticality thresholds. These tools are continually refined based on feedback and new fraud typologies.

### 4.2 Fraud Indicators
We have defined a set of indicators to facilitate fraud detection, including atypical transactional patterns (amounts, frequency, origins), inconsistencies in user information (identity, contact details), suspicious connections (geolocation, device, schedules), and similarities with known fraud cases. Each alert is analyzed by our anti-fraud team and proven cases lead to appropriate measures.

### 4.3 Continuous Monitoring
Anti-fraud monitoring is a continuous process that mobilizes dedicated resources, including a team of analysts in charge of 24/7 monitoring, real-time alert and reporting tools, regular analysis of trends and new threats, and monthly reporting to management on incidents and actions. Our system is regularly reviewed to adapt to changing risks.

## 5. Incident Management 

### 5.1 Investigation Process
Each alert or suspicion of fraud triggers a rigorous investigation process, including an initial analysis to confirm the suspicion and assess the impact, collection of evidence and reconstruction of the facts, complete documentation of the incident and actions taken, and an investigation report with conclusions and recommendations. Investigations are conducted in compliance with confidentiality and legal procedures.

### 5.2 Immediate Measures
In the event of proven fraud, precautionary measures are taken immediately, such as preventive blocking of affected accounts and transactions, securing funds to avoid additional losses, notifying stakeholders (customers, partners, authorities), and preserving evidence for possible prosecution. Our priority is to protect the interests of our users and our platform.

### 5.3 Corrective Actions
Each fraud incident leads to corrective actions to avoid any recurrence, including an analysis of root causes and exploited flaws, updating detection rules and parameters, strengthening controls and security procedures, and awareness and training actions for teams. The effectiveness of actions is monitored and lessons learned are documented.

## 6. Reporting and Communication

### 6.1 Internal Reporting 
Monitoring of fraud incidents is subject to regular internal reporting, including a daily report on alerts and ongoing investigations, a weekly analysis of trends and key indicators, a monthly update with management on major incidents, and an annual report presenting the assessment and areas for improvement. These reports make it possible to monitor the evolution of risks and the effectiveness of the system.

### 6.2 External Communication
External communication on fraud incidents is strictly regulated. Depending on the case, it may include mandatory notification to the competent authorities, information to the partners and service providers concerned, targeted communication to impacted customers and users, and regulatory reporting on significant incidents. Any external communication is validated by management and the legal department.

## 7. Training and Awareness

### 7.1 Training Program
All employees of lomi.africa Inc. follow a mandatory anti-fraud training program. This program includes initial training for new entrants, annual refresher sessions for all teams, specialized modules for the most exposed functions, and regular updates on new fraud typologies. The objective is to maintain a culture of vigilance at all levels of the company. 

### 7.2 Awareness
In addition to training, awareness actions are carried out with users of our platform, such as good practice guides to guard against fraud, targeted alerts in the event of new identified threats, prevention campaigns on social networks, and sharing of feedback and emblematic cases. The objective is to empower our users and make them actors in the fight against fraud.

## 8. Partnerships and Collaboration

### 8.1 Technical Partners
We work with leading technical partners to strengthen our anti-fraud system, including providers of behavioral analysis and scoring solutions, identity verification and compliance service providers, publishers of known fraud databases and sanctions lists, and experts in digital investigation and cybersecurity. These partnerships allow us to benefit from the best technologies and expertise on the market.

### 8.2 Collaboration 
We actively collaborate with ecosystem players to pool efforts to fight fraud, including information sharing with partner financial institutions, participation in industry working groups on fraud, regular exchanges with authorities and regulators, and active monitoring of new typologies and operating methods. This collaboration is essential to adapt to a constantly evolving threat environment.

## 9. Evaluation and Improvement

### 9.1 Performance Measures
We have defined key indicators to measure the performance of our anti-fraud system, such as the fraud detection rate and the amount of losses avoided, the average time to detect and resolve incidents, the false positive rate and the impact on the user experience, and the level of compliance with regulatory requirements. These indicators are monitored monthly and improvement objectives are set annually.

### 9.2 Continuous Improvement  
We are part of a continuous improvement process for our anti-fraud system, through regular review of our processes and procedures, technological monitoring of new detection solutions, systematic feedback on incidents handled, and taking into account comments from our customers and partners. Each incident is an opportunity to strengthen our system and disseminate good practices.

## 10. Compliance and Audit

### 10.1 Regulatory Compliance
Our anti-fraud policy is part of compliance with applicable regulations, including the requirements of payment schemes (PCI-DSS, 3D-Secure), data security standards (ISO 27001, GDPR), industry guidelines on fraud prevention, and due diligence and reporting obligations (AML/CFT, anti-bribery). We ensure that our system remains in compliance with regulatory changes.

### 10.2 Audit and Control
Our anti-fraud system is subject to regular internal and external controls, including annual internal audits by our audit department, external audits by specialized firms, regular penetration tests and security reviews, and annual compliance certification (PCI-DSS, ISO). The recommendations resulting from these audits are followed up and implemented as soon as possible.
