# Know Your Customer (KYC) Procedure

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Objective
This procedure defines the Know Your Customer (KYC) process within lomi.africa Inc. It aims to establish the identity of customers, understand their activities, and assess associated risks in accordance with applicable regulations. Our approach relies on a multi-step activation process that ensures thorough verification while providing a smooth user experience.

### 1.2 Scope
This procedure applies to all business relationships established by lomi.africa Inc., including new customers, existing customers, business partners, and beneficial owners. It covers the entire lifecycle of the customer relationship, from initial activation to ongoing monitoring.

## 2. Activation Process and KYC

### 2.1 Step 1 - Initial Registration
The process begins with an initial registration where the customer provides basic information, including the full name of the company, country of incorporation, industry sector, and contact details of the legal representative. This information allows for an initial assessment of the risk profile and determines the level of due diligence required.

### 2.2 Step 2 - Detailed Information
In this phase, we collect more in-depth information about the company, such as official identification documents, company structure and ownership, information on beneficial owners, and details of business activities. Particular attention is paid to the consistency and authenticity of the information provided.

### 2.3 Step 3 - Document Verification
This crucial step includes the analysis of provided identity documents, verification of the authenticity of company documents, validation of addresses and contact details, and screening against sanctions and PEP lists. We use automated verification tools combined with manual review by our experts.

### 2.4 Step 4 - Technical Validation
This phase involves the configuration of technical parameters, setting up transaction limits, establishing risk profiles, and activating security controls.

### 2.5 Step 5 - Final Activation
Final activation is granted only after complete validation of the KYC file, approval by the compliance committee, signing of necessary contracts, and configuration of access rights.

## 3. Levels of Due Diligence

### 3.1 Simplified Due Diligence
Applicable to low-risk customers, this level includes basic identity verification, sanctions list screening, light transaction monitoring, and annual periodic updates.
