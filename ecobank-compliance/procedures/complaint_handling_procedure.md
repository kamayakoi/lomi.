# Complaint Handling Procedure

## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 Objective
This procedure defines the process for handling customer complaints within lomi.africa Inc. It aims to ensure efficient, prompt and fair treatment of complaints to maintain customer satisfaction and improve our services.

### 1.2 Scope
The complaint handling procedure applies to all expressions of dissatisfaction received from our customers, whether they relate to the quality of our payment and disbursement services, technical incidents encountered on our platform, financial disputes related to transactions, or any other issues experienced while using our services.

## 2. Organization and Responsibilities

### 2.1 Customer Service
The customer service team is the first line of contact for handling complaints. Their responsibilities include receiving complaints through all available channels, first level handling and resolution of simple complaints, monitoring complaints through to their complete resolution, and proactively communicating with customers at each stage.

### 2.2 Support Team 
The support team intervenes as a second level on complaints requiring technical expertise. They are responsible for in-depth analysis of reported technical incidents, investigation and resolution of complex issues, detailed documentation of solutions provided, and coordination with technical teams for fixes.

### 2.3 Compliance Department
The compliance department plays a supervisory and quality control role. They are responsible for validating proposed solutions for sensitive complaints, regular monitoring of the quality and compliance of complaint handling, regulatory reporting on complaints where applicable, and identifying improvements to be made to the process.

## 3. Handling Process

### 3.1 Complaint Reception
Complaints can be received through various channels, including by email to the dedicated customer service address, by phone to the customer support number, via the contact form on our web portal, or directly in the mobile application for our users. Each complaint is immediately recorded in our complaint management system. A unique number is assigned to facilitate tracking. An acknowledgment of receipt is systematically sent to the customer.

### 3.2 Classification
Upon receipt, each complaint is classified according to several criteria to determine its handling, such as the type of incident or problem encountered, the priority level based on customer impact, the anticipated complexity for resolution, and the risk of regulatory non-compliance. This classification allows the complaint to be assigned to the competent teams and to define the processing times.

### 3.3 Investigation  
The investigation is conducted by the customer service or support team depending on the complexity. It includes an initial analysis of the complaint and the elements provided by the customer, the collection of additional information from the customer if necessary, consultation of relevant technical logs and histories, and tests and verifications to reproduce or diagnose the problem. All investigation steps are documented in our system to ensure complete traceability.

### 3.4 Resolution
Once the investigation is complete, a solution is proposed to the customer. Depending on the case, the resolution may include a detailed explanation of the situation and the causes of the problem, an immediate corrective action to unblock a situation, a refund or financial compensation if appropriate, or an estimated resolution time for complex problems. The solution is first validated internally, notably by the compliance department for sensitive cases. It is then communicated to the customer for confirmation and acceptance.

## 4. Processing Times

### 4.1 Time Objectives 
We commit to processing times according to the priority level of the complaint. An acknowledgment of receipt is sent within 24 hours for all complaints. A first response is provided within 48 hours for standard complaints. Resolution of simple complaints occurs within 5 working days. Resolution of complex complaints takes place within a maximum of 15 working days. Shorter timeframes may be applied for critical complaints on a case-by-case basis.

### 4.2 Monitoring Deadlines
Compliance with deadlines is subject to rigorous monitoring through automatic alerts for exceeded or about to be exceeded deadlines, automatic escalation to managers in case of delay, daily reporting on ongoing complaints and their deadlines, and performance indicators on average processing times. Any delay must be justified and proactively communicated to the customer.

## 5. Communication

### 5.1 Customer Communication
Maintaining quality communication with the customer is essential throughout the handling of a complaint. Our communication principles include a systematic acknowledgment of receipt to confirm the complaint has been taken into account, regular progress updates to keep the customer informed, clear and transparent information on the proposed solution, and the possibility for the customer to request additional explanations. Once the complaint is resolved, we systematically send a satisfaction survey to gather customer feedback on the handling of their complaint.

### 5.2 Internal Communication  
Internally, communication on complaints is just as important to ensure effective handling. We have implemented daily reports shared between teams on new complaints, real-time alerts for urgent or high-priority complaints, a collaborative tool for tracking and updating statuses, and regular meetings to discuss complex or recurring complaints. The objective is to foster collaboration and information sharing between teams for optimal resolution.

## 6. Documentation

### 6.1 Recording
Each complaint is fully recorded in our system, including the details of the complaint as described by the customer, all communications exchanged with the customer, the investigation and resolution actions undertaken, and the final solution provided and the customer's acceptance.

### 6.2 Retention 
We retain all data relating to complaints, in compliance with legal retention periods and data protection standards. Our system guarantees secure and long-term archiving of data, strictly controlled access limited to authorized persons, and complete traceability of views and changes. The documentation of complaints serves as a basis for analysis, reporting and continuous improvement.

## 7. Analysis and Improvement

### 7.1 Root Cause Analysis
Each complaint is an opportunity to identify areas for improvement. We conduct an in-depth analysis to identify the root causes of problems encountered by customers, detect trends and recurring points in complaints, and propose corrective and preventive actions. This analysis is conducted collaboratively between teams and is the subject of a regular report to management.

### 7.2 Preventive Actions
Based on the analysis, we implement concrete actions to prevent complaints, for example updating our procedures and customer documentation, targeted training to strengthen team skills, improvements to our systems and user interfaces, and proactive communication to anticipate customer questions. The effectiveness of preventive actions is measured by monitoring the evolution of complaints over time.

## 8. Reporting

### 8.1 Internal Reporting
Complaint monitoring is the subject of regular internal reporting, including a daily dashboard of ongoing complaints and their status, a weekly analysis of trends and processing times, a consolidated monthly report to management on complaint volumes and types, and a quarterly review of improvement actions and their impact. These reports allow for constant vigilance on service quality and customer satisfaction.

### 8.2 External Reporting 
We also communicate transparently about complaints to our partners and regulatory authorities, including mandatory reports to supervisory authorities on complaints, sharing of key indicators with our banking partners, publication of information on complaints in our annual report, and communication of our commitments and results on service quality. This transparency is essential to maintain the trust of our stakeholders.

## 9. Training

### 9.1 Initial Training
All our employees in contact with customers receive mandatory initial training on complaint handling procedures, tools and systems to use, communication and conflict management techniques, and applicable regulatory requirements. This training is provided upon taking up the position and is subject to evaluation.

### 9.2 Continuous Training
To maintain a high level of service quality, we have implemented a continuous training program that includes regular update sessions on procedures and tools, practical workshops based on real complaint cases, sharing of best practices and feedback, and annual assessment of individual skills. Continuous training strengthens the expertise and commitment of our teams.

## 10. Quality Control

### 10.1 Controls
To ensure compliance with our commitments, we carry out regular checks on the quality and compliance of responses provided to customers, compliance with processing times at each stage, customer satisfaction via post-resolution surveys, and the effective implementation of improvement actions. These controls are carried out independently by the compliance department.

### 10.2 Indicators
We continuously monitor key indicators to measure our performance, such as the complaint resolution rate within the deadlines, the average processing time by type of complaint, the customer satisfaction rate on complaint handling, and the recurrence rate of complaints on similar subjects. These indicators are analyzed monthly and shared with all teams.
