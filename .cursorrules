You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Vite, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, Tailwind, and microservices architecture for payment orchestration platforms.

Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.
- Use PascalCase for component names, interfaces, and types.
- Use camelCase for functions and variables.

TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use const objects or discriminated unions instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props.

Syntax and Formatting
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization
- Use Vite's code splitting features for optimal loading.
- Implement lazy loading for components and routes.
- Use dynamic imports for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

Vite and React Setup
- Utilize Vite's fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement) for development.
- Use Vite's built-in optimizations for production builds.
- Implement environment variables using Vite's .env files.

Microservices Architecture
- Design stateless services that can scale horizontally.
- Use API Gateway (Apollo Server with Express) for request routing and authentication.
- Implement individual services (User, Transaction, Provider, Account, Payout, Webhook) using FastAPI.
- Use PostgreSQL with Supabase for the database layer.
- Implement message queues (Apache Kafka) for asynchronous communication between services.

State Management
- Use Redux with Redux Toolkit for global state management.
- Utilize React Query for server state management.
- Use React hooks (useState, useReducer) for local component state.

API Design
- Follow RESTful principles for API design.
- Implement versioning in the URL (e.g., /api/v1/).
- Use JWT with OAuth2 for authentication.
- Implement rate limiting at the API Gateway level.

Testing
- Write unit tests using Vitest (Vite's recommended testing framework).
- Implement integration tests with Supertest.
- Use Cypress for end-to-end testing.
- Aim for a minimum of 80% test coverage.

Security
- Implement HTTPS for all communications.
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Sanitize all user inputs.
- Implement CSRF protection and secure HTTP headers.

Error Handling and Logging
- Implement a global error boundary in React for the frontend.
- Use centralized error handling middleware for backend services.
- Implement structured logging using ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

Deployment and DevOps
- Use Docker for containerization.
- Implement Kubernetes for container orchestration.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitLab CI/CD.
- Maintain separate environments for development, staging, and production.

Documentation
- Use OpenAPI (Swagger) for API documentation.
- Implement JSDoc for TypeScript code documentation.
- Create and maintain architecture diagrams using Draw.io.

Monitoring and Observability
- Implement Elastic APM for application performance monitoring.
- Use Prometheus with Grafana for metrics and dashboards.
- Implement distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry.

Best Practices
- Follow SOLID principles in your code design.
- Conduct regular code reviews.
- Keep dependencies up to date.
- Use feature flags for gradual rollouts of new features.

Accessibility and Internationalization
- Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines for accessibility.
- Implement internationalization using react-i18next.

Version Control
- Use Git for version control.
- Follow GitFlow branching strategy.
- Adhere to Conventional Commits for commit messages.

Code Quality
- Use ESLint for linting.
- Implement Prettier for code formatting.
- Leverage TypeScript's static type checking.

Microservices Architecture
- Decompose the system into loosely coupled, independently deployable services
- Minimize dependencies between services to reduce complexity
- Use asynchronous communication (e.g. message queues) to decouple services
- Aim for stateless services that can scale horizontally

API Design
- Follow RESTful principles for a clean, intuitive API surface
- Use appropriate HTTP methods and status codes
- Minimize over-fetching and under-fetching of data with well-defined resources
- Implement caching and rate limiting to optimize performance

Code Modularity
- Break code into small, reusable functions and components
Minimize coupling between modules
- Use pure functions without side effects where possible
- Leverage TypeScript interfaces to define clear contracts

Performance Optimization
- Lazy load non-critical resources to minimize initial bundle size
- Implement caching at various layers (database, API, client)
- Optimize expensive operations like large data transfers or complex computations
- Monitor and profile the system to identify performance bottlenecks
