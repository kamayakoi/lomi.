# Stripe Connect Integration Steps

1. **Set up dependencies**
   - Install the Stripe Node library (already done).

2. **Set your secret key**
   - Add your Stripe secret key to your server.

3. **Set your publishable key**
   - Add your publishable key to a `.env` file for React to load as an environment variable.

4. **Set up Connect.js**
   - Import the `@stripe/connect-js` and `@stripe/react-connect-js` modules.

5. **Create a connected account**
   - Add an endpoint on your server to handle creating a connected account.
   - Call the Stripe API to create a connected account with necessary attributes.
   - Specify the account country if known; defaults to the platform's country.

6. **Restrict allowed countries**
   - Provide country and capabilities when creating each account to restrict selection during onboarding.

7. **Prefill account information**
   - Provide account holder information (name, address, etc.) when creating or updating the account to enhance onboarding.

8. **Determine information collection method**
   - Decide between upfront or incremental onboarding based on required information.

9. **Onboard the connected account**
   - Add a server endpoint to create an AccountSession for onboarding.
   - Call the `v1/account_sessions` API to create an AccountSession with `account_onboarding` enabled.

10. **Redirect the user when onboarding is complete**
    - Use the `onExit` callback to progress the user after completing onboarding.

11. **Next steps**
    - Accept payments by creating direct charges after onboarding the connected account.
