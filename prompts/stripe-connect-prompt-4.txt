# Testing Stripe Connect

1. **Create test accounts**
   - Use the Accounts API or Stripe Dashboard
   - Use '000-000' as the SMS code for test accounts

2. **Test OAuth flow**
   - Use test mode client_id: ca_QjAr1qwhcRFCKqPpOjaS2vhdcTnbXaiY
   - Test features: non-HTTPS redirect_uri, localhost redirect_uri, force-skip account form

3. **Identity verification testing**
   - Use specific test tokens for dates of birth, addresses, personal ID numbers, and identity documents
   - Example: DOB '1901-01-01' for successful verification

4. **Business information verification**
   - Test business addresses, tax IDs, directorship, company name, statement descriptors, URLs, and DBA
   - Use specific tokens to trigger different verification conditions

5. **Trigger or advance verification**
   - Use trigger cards to simulate various conditions (e.g., 4000000000004202 to change eventually due requirements to currently due)
   - Test bank account ownership verification

6. **Simulate requirements**
   - Test different combinations of verified/unverified DOB and address

7. **Add funds to Stripe balance**
   - Use test bank tokens (e.g., btok_us_verified for successful addition)

8. **Test payouts**
   - Use test bank account numbers and debit card numbers
   - Example: IBAN AL35202111090000000001234567 for successful payout in Albania

9. **Best practices for testing**
   - Always use test mode and test keys
   - Test all possible scenarios and error conditions
   - Verify proper handling of webhooks and events
   - Test the entire user flow from account creation to payout

10. **Additional considerations**
    - Test with multiple account types and countries
    - Verify proper handling of capability updates and requirement changes
    - Test error handling and user notifications

Remember to thoroughly test your integration in test mode before going live with real accounts and transactions.
