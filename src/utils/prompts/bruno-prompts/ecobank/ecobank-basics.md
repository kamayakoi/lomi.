Sandbox Integration: Build your logic based on the sandbox services and requirements. At this stage you will be expected to do the following:

a- Token generation: Generate a token using the Token generation endpoint under the collection section, by passing the userId and password which would have been sent to you via email when registering for the sandbox access.

b- Hashing algorithm: This needs to be tested in isolation under the sandbox, the endpoint can be found under the collection Hashing Service , full details on how to do the computation available under the said collection.

c- Sending the request: Before sending the request ensure you had appended the generated token stated in the section a of this documentation on the authorisation of parameter of your JSON request, and also ensure the default origin is included in the header side of your request (developer.ecobank.com).
  PS ---- For the purpose of testing on the sandbox you are not expected to change the body of your json request but only to make use of the predefined data.

4- Complete the test case document: the test cases document received after the successful registration for the sandbox access needs to be completed based on the actual result of the test conducted on the sandbox. This will be required for upload during the request for go live phase.

5- Request for Go live: Go back to our developer's portal and click on Register for Go live. You will be required to login with the credentials that you chose during the registration for sandbox access phase. Once successfully authenticated you will be required to complete all basic KYC information and finally upload the the completed test case document and submit for review and approval.

6- Review & Approval: At this point we will receive your request for Go live and will contact you accordingly for any addition details or information to get you going on our production platform.
